This is the source of the Frugalware Linux installer.

To create an initrd image, you'll need some extrenal sources.
You can download them by 'cd cache; wget -i ../dl.lst' (or on amd64
  you need to use dl-x86_64.lst).
If you don't care about building as root, you can simply 'sudo make initrd',
and hopefully you'll get a vmlinuz* file and az initrd.img.gz.

If you want to run the commands as root only those are really necessary, first
use 'make' and then 'sudo make initrd'

Adding new translations:
1) first push the po file to the po/ dir
2) list the newly added language in src/plugins/asklang.c
3) modify the glibc buildscript to include support for the given locale
