This is the source of the Frugalware Linux installer.

Building
--------

1) run 'make config'
2) 'sudo make initrd' (you need to be root to be able to mount the initrd
   image file)
3) hopefully you'll get the vmlinuz* and initrd*.img.gz files

Adding new translations
-----------------------
1) first push the po file to the po/ dir
2) list the newly added language in src/plugins/asklang.c
3) modify the glibc buildscript to include support for the given locale

Adding new packages
-------------------

1) add the package to configure
2) add a target for it to Makefile
2) add the package to the source and packages list
