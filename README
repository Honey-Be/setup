This is the source of the Frugalware Linux installer.

Building
--------

Run 'sudo make'. You need to be root as the downloaded packages are
saved to pacman's cache and you need to be able to mount the initrd image file.

Hopefully you'll get the vmlinuz* and initrd*.img.gz files after make ends.

Cleaning up
-----------

If you built the initrd in the past and you don't want to start from scratch,
then use 'darcs pull' and 'sudo make distclen' to update the source and clean
up the generated files.

Adding new translations
-----------------------
1) first push the po file to the po/ dir
2) list the newly added language in src/plugins/asklang.c
3) modify the glibc buildscript to include support for the given locale

Adding new packages
-------------------

1) add the package to configure
2) add a target for it to Makefile
2) add the package to the source and packages list
