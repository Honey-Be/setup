This is the source of the Frugalware Linux installer.

Building
--------

As root, run the following commands:

./configure
make

You need to be root as the downloaded packages are saved to pacman-g2's cache
and you need to be able to mount the initrd image file. Hopefully you'll get
the vmlinuz* and initrd*.img.gz files after make ends. If you would like to
copy these to /usr/share/setup, issue 'make install' as root.

Cleaning up
-----------

If you have built the initrd in the past and you don't want to start from
scratch, just run 'make distclean' as root. If you are using setup from the
darcs repo, you should run 'darcs pull', too.

Adding new translations
-----------------------
1) first push the po file to the po/ dir
2) list the newly added language in src/plugins/asklang.c
3) modify the glibc buildscript to include support for the given locale

Adding new packages
-------------------

1) add the package to the packages array in configure
2) add a target for it in the Makefile
