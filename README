This is the source of the Frugalware Linux installer.

Internals
---------

The whole setup code is kept in the memory during the installation, so we try
to keep the it small. This means that all the programs we include in the initrd
is written in C or is a shellscript. No C++ or Python or anything else. For
detailed developer information, see the HACKING file.

Building
--------

As root, run the following commands:

./configure
make

You need to be root as the downloaded packages are saved to pacman-g2's cache
and you need to be able to mount the initrd image file. Hopefully you'll get
the vmlinuz* and initrd*.img.gz files after make ends. If you would like to
copy these to /usr/share/setup, issue 'make install' as root.

From scratch
------------

If you never compiled the setup, you need the following steps:

cd ~
mkdir git
cd git
git clone http://git.frugalware.org/repos/setup/.git
git clone http://git.frugalware.org/repos/translations/.git
su -
ln -s ~user/git ./
cd git/setup

then read the section titled "Building".

NOTE: you can place your setup repo where you want, and if you want to place
your translations repo somewhere else, you just need to edit po/Makefile.

Cleaning up
-----------

If you have built the initrd in the past and you don't want to start from
scratch, just run 'make distclean' as root. If you are using setup from the
git repo, you should run 'git pull', too.

Adding new translations
-----------------------
1) first create a translation using pootle
2) list the newly added language in src/plugins/asklang.c
3) modify the glibc buildscript to include support for the given locale

Adding new packages
-------------------

1) add the package to the packages array in configure
2) add a target for it in the Makefile
