preface
=======

the current /etc/sysconfig/interfaces has lots of limitations so
i've decided to rework the config file system & the initscript

the first problem is that there are no network profiles which are
preferred by mobile users. thus instead of the only
/etc/sysconfig/interfaces file, there will be a
/etc/sysconfig/network dir and on boot the "default" profile will
be loaded (of course that can be a symlink)

notes:
- this is currently only a plan, feel free to blame^H^H^H^H^Hcomment
  it
- converting the old config to the new format will be solved
- netconfig will be updated

here's a short draft about how a profile config will look:

global options
==============

# multiple usage ok
dns    = <ip>
# if defined more than once, the first will be used
domain = <domain>
# if defined more than once, the first will be used
desc   = <description>

interface options
=================

# multiple usage ok (for eth0:1, eth0:2, etc)
options   = <ip> [netmask <netmask> [broadcast <broadcast>]]
or
# if defined, then other option defines are ignored
options   = dhcp
# multiple usage ok
pre_up    = cmd
# multiple usage ok
post_up   = cmd
# multiple usage ok
pre_down  = cmd
# multiple usage ok
post_down = cmd
# if defined more than once, the first will be used
mac       = <mac addr>
# if defined more than once, the first will be used
essid     = <essid>
# if defined more than once, the first will be used,
# ignored if using dhcp
gateway   = [default gw] <ip>
# if defined more than once, the first will be used
key       = <key>

# if defined more than once, the first will be used
dhcp_host = <hostname>
