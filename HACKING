Patches
=======

If you have made changes to the source and would like to send these changes
to us, you can use darcs to send the changes.

darcs send --to=frugalware-devel@frugalware.org --from=your@email.addr.ess \
	--subject="My setup patch"

You need to make sure that Postfix or another Mail Transport Agent is running.

Testing changes
===============

When you make a change, PLEASE test it by building the initrd + kernel then
creating an ISO with mkiso, or using a network boot server. This is a core
part of Frugalware we're talking about here, if it's broken, then it can
render Frugalware uninstallable.
