Patches
=======

If you have made changes to the source and would like to send these changes
to us, you can use darcs to send the changes.

darcs send --to=frugalware-devel@frugalware.org --from=your@email.addr.ess \
	--subject="My setup patch"

You need to make sure that Postfix or another Mail Transport Agent is running.

Testing changes
===============

When you make a change, PLEASE test it by building the initrd + kernel then
creating an ISO with mkiso, or using a network boot server. This is a core
part of Frugalware we're talking about here, if it's broken, then it can
render Frugalware uninstallable.

Quick build
===========

Quick build means that once you built everything, and changed only the setup
code itself and you would like to test it. Building the initrd from scratch is
rather slow. We have three targets to prevent this problem:

# make setup - this builds setup itself

# make quick - this builds setup and updates the uncompressed initrd

$ make qemu - boots the brand new initrd
